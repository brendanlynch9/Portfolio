# Portfolio
A portfolio of proof of language ability. Please note to save space all dependencies have been removed from the files. The essence of the languages and functionality is being displayed. I have learned HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, React Native, Mongo DB, Express javascript, Node, Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP, Custom wordpress, Graph QL, C#,  ASP.Net MVC, unit testing with Jest  and many more. There is a summary of notes (like 400 pages typed so far and growing.. displayed as a commented out HTML file.) learned from countless bootcamps (angela Yu udemy web dev for 2020), Youtube videos (Mosh Hamedani , maximillian schwarzmueller etc.) and books etc.  I hope to be able to work as a humble MERN/React native or LAMP, or Custom wordpress developer. I spent many years working in medicine as an EMT and pharmacy Tech and am attempting to transition to a new career (I was injured saving others). Thank you for taking the time to read the ReadME.  I wish you all well.
